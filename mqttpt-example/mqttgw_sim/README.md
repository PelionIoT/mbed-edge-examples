## MQTT gateway simulator

This is an MQTT gateway simulator to test the `mqttpt-example` protocol translator without MQTT hardware. Publishes gateway status messages (`mqtt_gw.sh`) and device value messages (`mqtt_ep.sh`). The device script `mqtt_ep.sh` accepts parameters to register multiple devices or update sensor values, including temperature and humidity.

### Requirements
Requires `mosquitto_pub` client for publishing the MQTT messages to MQTT broker.
```
sudo apt install mosquitto-clients
```

### Usage
1. Run `edge-core` and `mqttpt-example`
2. Register MQTT gateway by running `mqtt_gw.sh` script.

```
./mqtt_gw.sh
```


3. Register device by running `mqtt_ep.sh` script.

```
./mqtt_ep.sh
```

4. Update certificates `cert_id_1` and `cert_id_2` on the gateway

```
./mqtt_gw_crypto_api.sh --renew-certificates cert_id_1 cert_id_2
```


5. Get certificate `cert_id_1`

```
./mqtt_gw_crypto_api.sh --get-certificate cert_id_1
```


6. Get public key for `cert_id_1`

```
$ ./mqtt_gw_crypto_api.sh --get-public-key cert_id_1
```


Notice that the device script accepts parameters for device name, temperature and humidity. For example to register device `MY_DEVICE` and set temperature value to 20.1C and humidity value to 67.5%:

```
./mqtt_ep.sh -d MY_DEVICE -t 20.1 -h 67.5
```


`mqtt_gw_crypto_api.sh` script can also be used to test rest of the crypto-features. Full list of the supported operations is

 * renewing certificates
 * getting certificate
 * getting public key
 * generating random bytearrays
 * performing asymmetric signing
 * verifying asymmetric signatures
 * performing ecdh key agremeent
